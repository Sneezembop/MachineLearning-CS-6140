Homework 4

Contents:
	Assignment 4.ipynb - the jupyter notebook with the python code for questions 4 - 7
	Python_Printout.pdf - the printout of the jupyter notebook file

To execute the code for this assignment simply unpack the zip then open Assignment 3.ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks.  This code uses Python 3.6

I have included .py files which are ports of the jupyter notebook files.  
I haven't run them and I don't have a huge amount of confidence in them.  
I highly recommend using jupyter notebook instead.
