The 3 ipython notebook files ending with .ipynb are the code for introduction of Python and NumPy/SciPy. The 3 html files contain the exactly the same content as the ipython notebooks. You can read the html files if you do not have ipython notebook installed and can not open the .ipynb files.

The folder contains the following files:
